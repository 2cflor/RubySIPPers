RubySIPPers
===========

[SIPp](http://sipp.sourceforge.net/) is a great tool for testing the SIP protocol.  However,
it can be difficult and error-prone to construct and maintain complex scenarios.

RubySIPPers is a framework built on top of SIPp which allows you to concisely express
the real scenario you are trying to test, and will coordinate multiple endpoints.

The code for RubySIPPers is being prepared for release by Marchex, please check back soon!
